      My NFTs and articulation of my accomplishments in CSSE are my skills made through constant learning and presistence throughout this trimester. I have learned so much, not just about JavaScript, but also real life skills such as time management, communication, and problem solving. I have also learned how to work with others and how to be a team player. I am proud of what I have accomplished this trimester and I am excited to continue learning and growing in the future.
